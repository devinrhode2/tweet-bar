  "readme": "# twitter-text-js\n\nA JavaScript utility that provides text processing routines for Tweets.  This library conforms to a common test suite shared by many other implementations, particularly twitter-text.gem (Ruby).  The library provides autolinking and extraction for URLs, usernames, lists, and hashtags.\n\n## NPM Users\n\nInstall it with: `npm install twitter-text`\n\nThe `twttr.txt` namespace is exported, making it available as such:\n\n``` js\nvar twitter = require('twitter-text')\ntwitter.autoLink(twitter.htmlEscape('#hello < @world >'))\n```\n\n## Extraction Examples\n\n    // basic extraction\n    var usernames = twttr.txt.extract_mentioned_screen_names(\"Mentioning @twitter and @jack\")\n    // usernames == [\"twitter\", \"jack\"]\n\n## Auto-linking Examples\n\n    twttr.txt.autoLink(\"link @user, please #request\");\n    \n    twttr.txt.autoLink(\"link @user, and expand url... http://t.co/0JG5Mcq\", { \n        urlEntities: [\n            {\n              \"url\": \"http://t.co/0JG5Mcq\",\n              \"display_url\": \"blog.twitter.com/2011/05/twitte…\",\n              \"expanded_url\": \"http://blog.twitter.com/2011/05/twitter-for-mac-update.html\",\n              \"indices\": [\n                30,\n                48\n              ]\n            }\n        ]});\n\nSee [Tweet Entities](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tweet-entities) for more info getting url entities from Twitter's API.\n    \n\n## Usernames\n\nUsername extraction and linking matches all valid Twitter usernames but does\nnot verify that the username is a valid Twitter account.\n\n## Lists\n\nAuto-link and extract list names when they are written in @user/list-name\nformat.\n\n## Hashtags\n\nAuto-link and extract hashtags, where a hashtag contains any latin letter or\nnumber but cannot be solely numbers.\n\n## URLs\n\nAsian languages like Chinese, Japanese or Korean may not use a delimiter such as\na space to separate normal text from URLs making it difficult to identify where\nthe URL ends and the text starts.\n\nFor this reason twitter-text currently does not support extracting or auto-linking\nof URLs immediately followed by non-Latin characters.\n\nExample: \"http://twitter.com/は素晴らしい\" .\nThe normal text is \"は素晴らしい\" and is not part of the URL even though\nit isn't space separated.\n\n## International\n\nSpecial care has been taken to be sure that auto-linking and extraction work\nin Tweets of all languages. This means that languages without spaces between\nwords should work equally well.\n\n## Hit Highlighting\n\nUse to provide emphasis around the \"hits\" returned from the Search API, built\nto work against text that has been auto-linked already.\n\n## Testing\n\n### Conformance\n\nThe main test suite is twitter-text-conformance.  This is set up as a git submodule that is automatically updated at each run.  Tests are run in your browser, using QUnit.  To run the conformance suite, from the project root, run:\n\n    rake test:conformance\n\nYour default browser will open the test suite.  You should open the test suite in your other browsers as you see fit.\n\n### Other Tests\n\nThere are a few tests specific to twitter-text-js that are not part of the conformance suite.  To run these, from the project root, run:\n\n    rake test\n\nYour default browser will open the test suite.\n\n## Packaging\n\nOfficial versions are kept in the `pkg/` directory.  To roll a new version, (ex. v1.1.0), run the following from project root:\n\n    rake package[1.1.0]\n\nThis will make a new file at `pkg/twitter-text-1.1.0.js`.\n\n## Reporting Bugs\n\nPlease direct bug reports to the [twitter-text-js issue tracker on GitHub](http://github.com/bcherry/twitter-text-js/issues)\n\n## Copyright and License\n\nCopyright 2011 Twitter, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this work except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License in the LICENSE file, or at:\n\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
